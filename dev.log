  Deep frustration. In order to stop the stream with anything other than 'exit' I'm probably going to have to hack the cinch gem. For now, it exits.

  The crawler does not update stop conditions such as time and record count. BUT it is updated within the write object.
  Therefore I created a file called counter that will monitor stop conditions and throw the stop error when needed.
  But it's late. Fill in the blanks tomorrow.

  Time to run the crawler.
  Having trouble with it. It seems to crawl but never writes out the posts. 
  BUG: Stop conditions (duration an counter) DO NOT WORK. WAIT! It threw "Stream Complete" as intended but did not stop. 
  BUG: If there is a duration, then there should only be a limit if the user specifies, and vice versa!
  
  #Can I do multiple streams at once? Yes. If I do, I need to include the channel in the meta data.  Can I log them to different files?

  Added last of the command line options. I think.
  Next: Actually gather the data as configured and record it.

  Created the project. Purpose: To make a simple to use command line crawler for irc channels. NOTE: Crawler. 1-way communication only.
  Parses Cinch gem output into several output formats.
